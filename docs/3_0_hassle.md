### 3.0 hassle

The reason 3.0 was publshed so preemptively was because I'm having some
individual hardship these days. Side project maintenance is becoming a burden
on current state, and I wanted to end a milestone at least giving complete
features for those who were waiting. Consuquently I missed one of the most
important feature for version 3.0. I tried to keep the project to comply with
semantic version as much as possible but looks like this will be an exception.

### 3.0.1 will be new stable release

3.0.1 version will be treated as real 3.0 version release. And 3.0 version will
not work same as upcoming versions.

The biggest update from 3.0 is argument parsing behaviour with related macro
name changes.

### R4d will have long term update

There will be bug fixes but feature update will be seldomly applied.
