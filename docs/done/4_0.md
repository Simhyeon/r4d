From 4.0

* [x] Added get-static-macro -> Is this 4.0?

### Bug fix

* [x] Argparser panics on
```
$define(t=0)
$append(t,t,,)
```
* [x] Alignby doesn't work properly
This was due to tab size... which is translated as 1 width by unicode.
This can be problematic in many cases, yet there is no migcal solutoin.
```
	[SchemeNorm] = { col_glightfg, col_glightbg, col_glightbg},
	[SchemeSel]  = { col_glightbg, col_glightfg, col_highlight},
   	// Statusbar right {text,background,not used but cannot be empty}
   	[SchemeStatus]  = { col_gray3, col_gray1,  "#000000"  }, 
=== With "rad --sc alignby ="
	[SchemeNorm]       = { col_glightfg, col_glightbg, col_glightbg},
	[SchemeSel]        = { col_glightbg, col_glightfg, col_highlight},
   	// Statusbar right {text,background,not used but cannot be empty}
   	[SchemeStatus]  = { col_gray3, col_gray1,  "#000000"  }, 
```
* [x] Rer is bugged -> In a very specific case 
* [x] Alignby removes content after separator if there are multiple separators.
* [x] Stream-chunk doesn't work...
* [x] Pipe input always tirggering skip_expansion is very tedious fix it asap

* CLI
    * [x] Fix manual macro cli problem...
* [x] Fixed a bug where dump didn't require fout permission.
* [x] So... pipe input was not working for the time... musseuk-tard
* [x] Looks like skip_expansion variable inside evluate method does nothing?
* [x] Pipe should escape everything. Not parse it...?
* [x] Fixed strange behaviour of stream-chunk and stream-lines
* [x] Grepmap doesn't work?
    -> Wow, this was not parsing at all... Really?
* [x] Applied unicodewidth for alignby
* [x] Package feature may not working for now
    -> I didn't know how to use package feature LUL.
* [x] Metl is bugged

### MISC

* [x] Now greedy arguments doesn't strip literal characters
* [x] Upgrade dependencies for sure
    * [x] Deprecate lazy_static and use once_cell
    * [x] Implemnet join for dcsv value -> Instread I imported itertools
    * [x] Check if flate crate is necessary -> Yes it is used in packaing
    * [x] Upgrade clap
        -> Currnetly clap compiles thus it should be ok?
* [x] ERGO : No such macro prints similar macro name.

### New macros / Macro

* [x] - ( Not exactly )No pipe truncate option for macro users.
    -> This was implemented as binary option (flag)
* [x] Percent macro
* [x] Print macro
    This overrides discard macro and print to stdout on necessary.

* [x] Added forsp ( For space )
* [x] Unicode length macro
* [x] Add Squeeze macro

    -> Now this is insulah
* [x] New macro lipsum repeat
* [x] Change istype syntax
* [x] Renamed isolate to insulav
* [x] Isolate for line -> Insulah
* [x] Cond  : Condense ( remove duplicate whitespaces from an input )
* [x] Condl : Condense by lines ( remove duplicate whitespaces from an input )
* [x] Alignby
    * [x] Now add a documentation for it
* [x] Add rer macro ( Rearrange )
* [x] NEW: Stream macro
    * [x] Enable anon macro in macro invocation
    * [x] Stream lines macro
* [x] Stripfl

* [x] New flag: Stream-lines
* [x] New flag: Stream-chunk
    * [x] Enhance stream_chunk newline stripping
    * [x] Unify starting logger index between lines and chunk
    * [x] Remove unnecessary process_string from flag related logics
