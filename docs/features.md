### Why so many features?

Many functions are feature gated by default because the features require
separated crated to be compiled. R4d was designed to be as light as possible
thus I thought giving many choices to user was desirable.

Hook is feature gated because hook is very rarely used, and costs extra step to
check hooks while analyzing macro codes.
