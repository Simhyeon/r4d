Que an expression. Queued expressions are expanded when the macro finishes

Use a que macro when macros do operations that do not return a string AND you 
need to make sure the operation should happen only after all string manipulation 
ended. Halt is queued by default.

Que does not evalute inner contents and simply put expression into a queue.

# NO expansion at all

# Arguments

- a_expr : An expression to queue

# Example

$que(halt(false))
