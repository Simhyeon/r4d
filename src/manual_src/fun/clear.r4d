Clear volatile macros. 

# NOTE

- This macro is intended to be used when hygiene mode is enabled and user wants
  to clear volatiles immediately without waiting.
- Currently published binary doesn't have flags to control hygiene of macro
  processing. Use r4d as library if you want fine control over processing

# Demo
