Print a comma

# NOTE

- This is a "semantic" purpose macro
- Use escaped comma `\,` if you want to use literal comma as arguments but the
  content has to be positioned other than last argument. For better
  understanding, refer r4d's internal document from repository.

# Demo

```
$def(t=t)
$append(t,, t)        % Hard to read
$append(t,$comma() t) % Better readability
$t()
===
t, t, t
```

# Example

$assert(\*,*\,$comma())
