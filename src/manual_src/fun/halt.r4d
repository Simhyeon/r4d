Halt relaying

# NOTE 

- Also refer relay for full usage
- Halt is automatically queued by default. Feed an optional argument to
  configure this behaviour
- Refer [link] to understand why halt has to be queued.
- $halt(false) == $halt()
- use $halt(true) to immediately halt

# Demo

```
$decl(conto)
$relay(macro,conto)
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
$halt()
$conto^()
===
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
```

# Example

$define(cont=)
$relay(macro,cont)
12345
$halt()
$assert(12345,$cont^())
