Get a length of text. This counts length as utf8 characters

# Return : Unsigned integer

# Note

- This might be different from what user expect since length has different
  meanings in different contexts. For example, Non ASCII text "안녕하세요"
  has length of 5 while ascii text 'hello' also has length of 5.
- If you simply want "displayed" length, use "ulen" macro.
