- A temporary file name is merged to a temporary directory. You cannot 
set a temporary file outside of a temporary directory.
- This macro needs FOUT permission because it creates a temporary file if the 
file doesn't exist

# Arguments

- a_filename : A new temporary file path ( trimmed )

# Demo

$tempto(new.txt)

```
